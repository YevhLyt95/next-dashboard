## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the project for the Next.js App Router Course. It now contains the following code for the dashboard application.
But Iâ€™ve customized it to support full local development:

- Added local PostgreSQL via Docker
- Integrated Prisma for type-safe database access
- Created `.env.example` for environment clarity
- Added `docker-compose.yml` for easy setup
- Preserved compatibility with Vercel deployment
